# Beat Machine

Check it out [here](https://mackenziewritescode.github.io/markdown-app/).

This is a little drum machine made using React and styled with SCSS. It is composed of nine pads that can be activated by either clicking on them or pressing their corresponding keys, a background track player that plays independant, looping tracks, and a volume slider that adjusts the volume of both the pads and the background tracks.

All the code is written from scratch. You can have a look at /src/App.js and /src/App.scss. The code is written as cleanly, logically and legibly as possible, keeping Reactâ€™s best practices in mind. I encourage you to check it out!

Have fun making some sweet beetz.
