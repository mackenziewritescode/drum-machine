# Beat Machine

Check it out [here](https://www.sunkenworld.com/drum-machine).

This is a little drum machine made using React and styled with SCSS. It is composed of nine pads that can be activated by either clicking on them or pressing their corresponding keys, a background track player that plays independant, looping tracks, and a volume slider that adjusts the volume of both the pads and the background tracks.
